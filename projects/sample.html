            <h1>The Third Space</h1>
            <p>
              My partner and I designed activities to research transportation habits and work environments and develop an in-vehicle system. The system manipulates internal and external environmental factors to create an ideal work and travel space.

              with the concept of a “third space” away from work and home. The

              own product concept, while keeping in mind the context of
              transportation.

                <p>
                  In the age of workaholics, people are spending increasing
                  amounts of time in the office. Companies are moving away from
                  traditional cubicles to more creative work spaces — one
                  direction is incorporating nature. Modern workers enjoy nature
                  in their work environments, but they also value
                  customizability and comfort. How do we design a space with
                  nature that allows user control?

                <p>
                  ACCLIMATE is a smart in-vehicle system. Using information from
                  the external environment, it combines natural and artificial
                  conditions to create a custom setting. The system also allows
                  users to manually adjust sound, lighting, and climate within
                  the vehicle. It serves as a portable space adaptable for work
                  and transportation.
